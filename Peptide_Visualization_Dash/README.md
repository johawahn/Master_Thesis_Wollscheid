# Prototype of Dash App 

Prototype of dash app that allows for the visualization of peptides based on their m/z (mass-to-charge ratio) and RT (retention time) and highlights all of the peptides assigned to the same protein once the user hovers over a peptide. The coordinates for each peptide are extracted from the psm.tsv output file of the FragPipe software (https://github.com/Nesvilab/FragPipe) using the extract_mz_rt_psm_app.py tool.
